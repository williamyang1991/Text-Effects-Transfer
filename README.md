I fixed a bug and changed something so that it can be more convenient to use. (*^â–½^*)

# Text-Effects-Transfer

This is a Matlab implementation of the paper.

Shuai Yang, Jiaying Liu, Zhouhui Lian and Zongming Guo, 
Awesome Typography: Statistics-Based Text Effects Transfer, 
Accepted by IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

This code builds upon the PatchMatch algorithm (https://github.com/jbhuang0604/StructCompletion) implemented by Jia-Bin Huang.
